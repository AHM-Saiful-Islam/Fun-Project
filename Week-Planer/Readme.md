# Django Week Planner

A simple yet efficient **Week Planner** web application built using Django. The Week Planner allows users to manage tasks for the week by adding, viewing, and marking tasks as completed. The project showcases a solid understanding of Django's core features, including models, forms, views, templates, and database migrations.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks specifying the title, description, day, time, and date from both the front-end interface and Django admin.
- **View Weekly Tasks**: Tasks are displayed in a list format, organized by day and time.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can toggle a task's completion status using a dynamic button.
- **Responsive Design**: Includes intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for adding and managing tasks.
- **Database Integration**: Data is persisted using Django's ORM and supports dynamic updates.

## Workflow

1. **Set up a Virtual Environment**

   your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Django**  
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

3. **Create a Django Project and App**  
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject project_name
   cd project_name
   python manage.py startapp planner
   ```

4. **Configure the Project**  
   - Add the app (`planner`) to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the `settings.py` file.

5. **Define the Task Model**  
   Create the `Task` model in `planner/models.py` with fields for `title`, `description`, `day`, `time`, `date`, and `completed`.

6. **Run Migrations**  
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Create Forms**  
   Create a `TaskForm` in `planner/forms.py` for task input.

8. **Define Views**  
   Implement views in `planner/views.py` for adding tasks, displaying tasks, and toggling completion.

9. **Configure URLs**  
   - Define app-specific URLs in `planner/urls.py`.
   - Include app URLs in the main `project_name/urls.py`.

10. **Create Templates**  
    - `week_planner.html`: Displays tasks and their statuses.
    - `add_task.html`: Provides a form for adding new tasks.
